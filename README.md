# DeepLink

Create and use type-safe deep links using Swift macros.

```swift
@DeepLink(generateInitWithURL: true)
public struct SearchDeepLink: DeepLink {
    public static let scheme = "example"

    @Host
    private let host = "search"

    @PathItem
    public var category = "all"

    @QueryItem(name: "q")
    public var query: String
}

// DeepLink will add `url` property and `init(url:)`

SearchDeepLink.scheme // "example"
SearchDeepLink(query: "hello world").url.absoluteString // "example://search/all?q=hello%20world"

let deepLink = SearchDeepLink(url: URL(string: "example://search/tv?q=still%20up")!)!
deepLink.category // "tv"
deepLink.query // "still up"
```

## Supported Apps

## Type Flexibility

Rather than being strict with its typings DeepLink relies on string interpolation to build URLs. This allows properties to be any type that conforms to `CustomStringConvertible`, such as `Int`s, enums, and custom types.

If a property is optional it will only be used to build the URL when it is non-nil. This is particularly useful for optional query items.

This also extends to initialising a deep link with a `URL` -- as long as the type conforms to `LosslessStringConvertible`.

## Status

I currently class DeepLink as a beta package. I'm not aware of any issues with the implementation but I am holding off on a 1.0 until I'm happier with the API. API will changes will include `@available(*, deprecated, renamed: "<new-name>")` where possible so updating should not be painful.

### Minimum for 1.0

Some things I would class as required for the 1.0:

- `@Fragment`
- More tests
- Full documentation
- Feedback to validate how clear the API is and what features are important

### Post 1.0

There's a lot that could be done in future releases, such as:

- Support for more apps
- Add metadata for external tools to read (https://github.com/JosephDuffy/DeepLink/pull/4)
  - Could enable creating a tool for generating and testing deep links (https://github.com/JosephDuffy/DeepLink/pull/5)
- Support for `init(url:)` in more scenarios (e.g. optional `@PathItem`s)

## Why

The idea for this came about when I saw the [URL scheme for Callsheet on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@caseyliss/111024103966666334), which made me think about how I added the Ivory URL scheme in to an [unreleased project of mine](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/FediFriend "FediFriend on GitHub").

I then thought this would be an interesting project to use Swift macros with and at that point I had nerd sniped myself. I also think it's useful to have a repository of the URL schemes available for various apps.

## Generating Links

The Swift REPL can be used to generate links in the terminal. This can be useful to test how other apps work, or if you're adding support for a new app to test that the generated strings work (this is not a substitute for unit tests ðŸ˜‰).

```shell
# Assumes you're in the package's root
$ swift run --repl
```
