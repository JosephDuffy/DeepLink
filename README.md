# DeepLinks

The `DeepLinks` package enables easily creating type-safe deep links. Deep links for some apps are included with the package. For apps that aren't included custom deep link types can be created using the `@DeepLink` macro.

```swift
@DeepLink
public struct SearchDeepLink: DeepLink {
    public static let scheme = "example"

    @Host
    private let host = "search"

    @PathItem
    public var category = "all"

    @QueryItem(name: "q")
    public var query: String

    // @DeepLink macro adds this
    public var url: URL {
        var components = URLComponents()
        components.scheme = Self.scheme
        components.host = "\(self.host)"
        components.path = "/\(self.category)"
        let queryItems: [URLQueryItem] = [
            URLQueryItem(name: "q", value: self.query)
        ]
        components.queryItems = queryItems
        return components.url!
    }
}

// example://search/all?q=hello%20world
SearchDeepLink(query: "hello world").url.absoluteString
```

## Generating Links

The Swift REPL can be used to generate links in the terminal. This can be useful to test how other apps work, or if you're adding support for a new app to test that the generated strings work (this is not a substitute for unit tests ðŸ˜‰).

```shell
# Assumes you're in the package's root
$ swift run --repl
```

```
Welcome to Apple Swift version 5.9 (swiftlang-5.9.0.128.2 clang-1500.0.40.1).
Type :help for assistance.
  1> import CallsheetDeepLink
  2> ActivateInput().url
$R0: Foundation.URL = "callsheet://activateInput"
```

## Future Direction

- Support for more apps
- Generate an initialiser the parses a `URL`
- Add metadata for external tools to read
  - Could enable creating a tool for generating and testing deep links
