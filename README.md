# DeepLinks

The `DeepLinks` package provides various libraries for creating deep links in to apps.

## Generating Links

The Swift REPL can be used to generate links in the terminal. This can be useful to test how other apps work, or if you're adding support for a new app to test that the generated strings work (this is not a substitute for unit tests ðŸ˜‰).

```shell
# Assumes you're in the package's root
$ swift run --repl
```
