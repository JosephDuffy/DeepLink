# DeepLinks

The `DeepLinks` package enables easily creating type-safe deep links. Deep links for some apps are included with the package. For apps that aren't included custom deep link types can be created using the `@DeepLink` macro.

```swift
@DeepLink(scheme: "example")
public struct SearchDeepLink: DeepLink {
    @Host
    private let host = "search"

    @PathItem
    public var category = "all"

    @QueryItem(name: "q")
    public var query: String
}

// DeepLink will add `url` and `scheme`

// "example"
SearchDeepLink.scheme

// "example://search/all?q=hello%20world"
SearchDeepLink(query: "hello world").url.absoluteString
```

## Type Flexibility

Rather than being strict with its typings DeepLink relies on string interpolation to build URLs. This allows properties to be any type that conforms to `CustomStringConvertible`, such as `Int`s, enums, and custom types.

If a property is optional it will only be used to build the URL when it is non-nil. This is particularly useful for optional query items.

## Generating Links

The Swift REPL can be used to generate links in the terminal. This can be useful to test how other apps work, or if you're adding support for a new app to test that the generated strings work (this is not a substitute for unit tests ðŸ˜‰).

```shell
# Assumes you're in the package's root
$ swift run --repl
```

```
Welcome to Apple Swift version 5.9 (swiftlang-5.9.0.128.2 clang-1500.0.40.1).
Type :help for assistance.
  1> import CallsheetDeepLink
  2> ActivateInput().url
$R0: Foundation.URL = "callsheet://activateInput"
```

## Future Direction

- Support for more apps
- Generate an initialiser the parses a `URL`
- Add metadata for external tools to read
  - Could enable creating a tool for generating and testing deep links
